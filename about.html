   <main>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Anand Sharma, and I am a passionate IT student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA). At the age of 19, I find myself standing at an exciting crossroads, where I am learning, experimenting, and building a future in the ever-evolving world of technology. My journey is just beginning, but with every new skill I pick up and every project I work on, I feel myself growing closer to the kind of developer and professional I aspire to be.

<h2>My Educational Journey</h2>

I am pursuing my BCA as the foundation of my career in technology. This course has introduced me to the fundamentals of programming, databases, networking, and the theoretical aspects of computer science. While I am grateful for the academic framework my education has provided, I believe in going beyond the classroom. The truth is that I sometimes feel my institute doesn’t provide the level of exposure or practical knowledge that I would ideally want. But instead of letting that hold me back, I see it as an opportunity to take charge of my own learning journey.

Outside of the curriculum, I continuously practice coding, experiment with small projects, and explore resources available online to strengthen my skills. From building simple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understanding basic programming in Python and C, I enjoy taking challenges that help me translate theoretical knowledge into real-world applications.

Education for me isn’t just about grades or certificates—it’s about building the skills and mindset to solve problems. And that is what I strive to do each day.

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>

While I am still at an early stage in my career, I have built a foundation of skills that I am constantly expanding. Some of the key areas I am focusing on include:

Front-End Development:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages I am most comfortable with. I can design and structure web pages, experiment with layouts, and create user-friendly interfaces.

Currently, I am learning how to make my websites more interactive and visually appealing by using responsive design principles.

Programming Basics:

I have worked with Python, C, and am exploring Java. My knowledge may be basic at this stage, but I enjoy problem-solving and practicing coding exercises to sharpen my logical thinking.

One of my favorite things about programming is how it trains the brain to think systematically and break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

Database Management:

I am familiar with SQL and understand how to create and manage databases.

Though I am still learning advanced queries and database optimization, I enjoy the structured nature of working with data.

Web Design and Styling:

Beyond functionality, I take interest in the design aspect of web projects. I like experimenting with color schemes, layouts, and typography to create websites that feel modern and user-friendly.

<h3>Tools and Technologies:</h3>

GitHub for version control.

VS Code as my primary code editor.

Canva and other design tools for creating simple graphics.

I may not yet be an expert, but I am deeply motivated to learn, practice, and grow until I reach a level where I can build professional-grade applications and solutions.

<h3>Personal Traits and Personality</h3>
A portfolio is more than just a list of technical abilities—it should also reflect who I am as a person. I believe my personality plays just as important a role in my growth as my education and skills.

Introverted but Observant:
I naturally lean towards being introverted, which means I often enjoy listening, observing, and reflecting before speaking. While I may not always be the loudest voice in the room, I bring a thoughtful perspective and pay attention to details that others might overlook.

Curious and Self-Motivated:
My curiosity is what drives me to learn beyond the syllabus. Whenever I come across a new concept or tool, I find myself researching it, trying it out, and experimenting with how it works.

Adaptable and Resilient:
Sometimes I face challenges, whether it’s struggling to understand a coding concept or dealing with lack of guidance in my academic environment. But instead of giving up, I adapt. I try different approaches, seek out tutorials, and keep pushing until I make progress.

Goal-Oriented:
Even though I am still in the early stages of my career, I am clear about one thing—I want to create meaningful work in technology. My ultimate goal is to become not only a skilled software developer but also someone who contributes value to businesses, projects, and communities.

Desire for Growth:
I am also aware of the areas I want to improve in. For example, I want to become more confident in communication, especially when talking to new people or presenting my work. I am actively working on becoming more extroverted and developing strong professional and personal communication skills.

Creative Thinker:
While logic and technical knowledge are essential in IT, I believe creativity is equally important. I love brainstorming ideas for designs, problem-solving in unconventional ways, and thinking of solutions that are both effective and innovative.

<h2>Projects and Practical Experience</h2>

Although I am still building my portfolio, I have already started working on smaller projects that showcase my learning:

Portfolio Website: The very site you are reading right now is one of my favorite projects. It’s more than just a web page—it represents who I am, what I can do, and where I am headed. Designing it from scratch allowed me to put my HTML and CSS skills into practice.

Forms and Templates: I have created sign-up forms, restaurant website templates, and other HTML projects as practice assignments. Each one has helped me understand how real-world websites are structured.

Freelancing Exploration: I am beginning to learn how freelancing platforms work and how I can use my skills to provide value to clients. Writing proposals, understanding project needs, and practicing communication are experiences I am adding to my journey.

Each of these projects may be small, but they are stepping stones. Every single one adds to my confidence, improves my skills, and prepares me for larger challenges ahead.

<h3>Career Goals</h3>

Looking forward, I have set clear goals for myself:

Strengthen Technical Expertise: Continue learning programming languages, frameworks, and technologies until I am fully confident in building complete software and web applications.

Develop a Professional Portfolio: Showcase projects that go beyond simple assignments—real, polished, and impactful projects that demonstrate what I can do.

Freelancing and Work Opportunities: Start taking small projects online to gain professional experience and earn while learning.

Personal Development: Work on my communication, confidence, and leadership skills so that I can interact better with clients, teams, and colleagues in the future.

Long-Term Vision: Eventually, I see myself as a full-stack developer or IT professional who combines technical knowledge with creativity and problem-solving to deliver outstanding solutions.

Beyond Work and Studies

While most of my focus is on education and career, I also believe in living a balanced life. I like reading about technology trends, exploring self-improvement content, and staying curious about the world. Fitness and health are areas I want to focus on more because I believe a strong mind goes hand in hand with a strong body.

I am also fascinated by entrepreneurship. One day, I hope to not only work on projects for others but also create something of my own—a startup, product, or service that makes a real impact.

<h3>Why Work With Me</h3>

If you’re reading this as a potential collaborator, client, or employer, here’s why I believe I’d be a great choice to work with:

I bring fresh energy and curiosity—always ready to learn and adapt.

I am detail-oriented, so I don’t just complete a task but also focus on making it polished and presentable.

I am honest about what I know and what I don’t know. If something is new to me, I am eager to learn it quickly rather than pretending to know it.

My long-term commitment is to grow in this field, so I take every project seriously as part of my learning and career-building process.

<h3>Closing Note</h3>

To sum it up, I am Anand Sharma—a young, motivated IT student who is passionate about technology, eager to learn, and excited to grow both professionally and personally. I may be at the beginning of my journey, but I carry with me a strong sense of purpose, a determination to succeed, and the belief that every small step counts.
